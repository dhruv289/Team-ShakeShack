As noted in the Project Description, AS-P will serve a small number of clinics in the NT Islands and HK Southern District groups, and you will be supplied with all location data and inter-location distances.

Initially your system will serve the following 8 locations (7 clinics and the supplying hospital).  Please be sure to load the data before your Elaboration demo. 

For AS-P, you can assume that the distance from any location A to any location B is the same as the reverse distance from B to A. The full Air Supply system will use effective distances that also reflect current weather conditions and the A->B distance may be different from the B->A distance, however this is not a concern for the simpler AS-P system.

For each location, the following are provided below: name, latitude, longitude, and altitude.

Inter-location distances are given for all pairs of locations.

To ensure your system can be extended, you will be required to add at least one further location directly ahead of your final demo at the end of Construction 2. You can make the additions through Django Admin; an interface is not required.
